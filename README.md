# Simple_Linear_Regression

I applied simple linear regression on the dataset which contains the sales number based on the number of advertisement of the particular 'TV'.
Fisrt I analysed the data after that i performed some cleaning steps whether there is any Null Values, Duplicate Value and Outliers etc.
After that I visulaized my data using a scatter plot and checked whether my data is Linear or Not.
Moreover, I Imported a Linear Regression model and fitted my training data into it and predicted the values based on the testing data.
I checked my model accuracy by using r2_score, mean_squarred_error metrics

Conclusion: I can that the accuracy score of my model is not that much good  we can optimize this dataset for the better resuts.
